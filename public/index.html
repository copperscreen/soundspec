      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

	<div id="help">That's a tool for desiging a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POKEY" target="_blank">POKEY</a>-like chip specs. The chip has a master clock that is divided into (you set how many) derived clocks
 that drive the counters that switch the output level between zero and a selected volume level. Tune the counters number and width for the notes, 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear-feedback_shift_register#Applications" target="_blank">LFSR</a> params for the noise and play some music to check if it sounds fine. The only significant feature here that is absent in POKEY is that you can
 pair channels so that one channel counter is initialized from alternating channels, effectively performing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation#Audio_effects_and_amplification" target="_blank">PWM</a>. The volume/frequency envelopes that can be edited 
for each instrument are processed every <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_blanking_interval" target="_blank">vblank</a>. If you have MIDI keyboard (or two!) and your browser supports it you can use it here.
<br>
<br>
Use Ctrl and Shift to choose an octave for the keyboard. Instruments 1-2 are mapped to midi keyboards / computer keyboard, 
instruments 4-6 are mapped to Insert, Home and PageUp keys (use them as percussion).

Click an area header to fold the area back. Click the green dot to undo a corresponding instrument edit (if the dot is red there are no undo steps left).
To swap instrument settings click a number on the instrument header.
